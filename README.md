The extension will automatically enhance the website with additional profiles and features.

## Information
The sole purpose of War Thunder Profiles + is to augment the default player statistics page on the War Thunder website by providing a layer of additional, valuable information.
It simplifies the process of tracking and interpreting personal gaming metrics for a more enjoyable and in-depth gaming analysis experience.

## Host Permissions
War Thunder Profiles + requires host permission to operate effectively on the War Thunder website.
This permission is essential for the extension to inject additional statistics and user profile enhancements directly onto the stats page.
The extension is designed to read and interpret the displayed data to generate enriched player cards.
It does not modify the underlying website or interfere with user data; it simply serves to offer a richer, more detailed view of player statistics.
